So the project phase is going to start in few days and I am so under the pump :smiley:. I had promised my mentors that I will look through existing methods that can be used to count and track people and find out which approach works better by testing all of them. The methods I want to look at are:
1. [CSRnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10062.pdf)
2. [SS-DCNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01886.pdf)
3. [Deep SORT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf)  
I am in the process of setting up necessary environments for each of the methods. I will soon update more regarding this.
