After considering declining support for Python 2 programming language and added benefits from upgrades to Python 3, it is always advisable for a developer to select Python version 3. So, from the statement above, it is pretty much abvious that the first task assigned to me was porting the [People Counter](https://github.com/robocomp/human-detection/tree/master/components/peopleCounter) module from Python 2 to Python 3 which is done.
But, in this process I learnt that due to significant refactoring done in the latest version python openpifpaf library some functions also need to be changed accordingly in our component. This process is underway. I will share the details of the exact changes I had to make soon!!

##### Status: In-progress
