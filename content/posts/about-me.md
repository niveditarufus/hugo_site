I am Nivedita Rufus. I am an active researcher and very passionate about Robotics. So, owing to my passion I primarily work with ‘Self-Driving Cars’ which is also part of my research work at IIIT- Hyderabad, India. I am also a GSoC'20 intern at RoboComp and will be working on the project “Software agent for estimating occupancy in medium and large buildings using RGB cameras”. This blog will be mostly about my GSoC journey.
