**"If you do what you love, you never have to work in your life."**  
I feel so good at the same time a little disappointed that my GSoC journey is in the wrap-up phase. It was my privilege to work for RoboComp. I started out not knowing much, but in these three months, the amount of learning that happened was exponential. This is probably the most productive summer I have ever had. You can find my contributions to RoboComp [here](https://github.com/niveditarufus/human-detection/tree/gsoc). I would like to thank my mentors who have been supportive and approachable throughout this journey making it an incredible one. I hope I have delivered what I had proposed.  
I also managed to opensource my own repositories on GitHub which might be helpful for people who would want to do something similar. My GSoC 20 journey may have come to an end, but I will still be an avid programmer and an active contributor to the community. Hope we cross paths sometime!:wink:
