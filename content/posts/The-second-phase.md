I so pumped up right now because I passed the first evaluation and will be getting paid soon :relieved::sweat_smile:. This has been a wonderful journey till now and I have no idea how the time passed so fast. Someone once said, "Do what you love, you never have to work a day in your life", I guess I have seen the truth to this statement. I am extremely grateful to my mentors for giving me the freedom to explore many things in this endeavor and without even knowing it I have learned so much :smiley:.  
I am looking forward to the next phase of my GSoC journey. I have started on some preliminary codes, so stay tuned for the results.
