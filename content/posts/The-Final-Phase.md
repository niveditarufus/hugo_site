I am in the last leg of my GSoC journey. This has been an incredible experience so far. The amount of learning I have done is indeed incredible and is something to be really grateful for. Initially, I was quite anxious if would be able to deliver what I had promised. Now it looks like I would be able to more than that :relieved::sweat_smile:.  
I am really looking forward to reaching the finish line smiling but at the same time a little sad that it would bring my GSoC journey to an end. This is perhaps one of the most productive endeavors I have embarked upon :heartpulse::heartpulse:.  
Do stay tuned in Sfor future posts regarding my project.
